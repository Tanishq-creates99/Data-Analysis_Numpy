-- NumPy (or Numpy) is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reason it is so important for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks.

-- Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries. For more info on why you would want to use Arrays instead of lists, check out this great [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/993984/why-numpy-instead-of-python-lists).

We will only learn the basics of NumPy, to get started we need to install it!

## Installation Instructions

**It is highly recommended you install Python using the Anaconda distribution to make sure all underlying dependencies (such as Linear Algebra libraries) all sync up with the use of a conda install. If you have Anaconda, install NumPy by going to your terminal or command prompt and typing:**
    
    conda install numpy
    
**If you do not have Anaconda and can not install it, please refer to [Numpy's official documentation on various installation instructions.](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/user/install.html)**
